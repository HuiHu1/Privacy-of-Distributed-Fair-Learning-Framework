# Privacy-of-Distributed-Fair-Learning-Framework

In this project, we focuses on studying the vulnerability of this framework under inference attacks. 
We design an attack strategy that infers the protected demographics by solving an integer programming problem,
then design a defense mechanism that perturbs the distributed learner.
