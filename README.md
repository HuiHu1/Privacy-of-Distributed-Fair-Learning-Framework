# Privacy-of-Distributed-Fair-Learning-Framework

In this project, we focuses on studying the vulnerability of the proposed distributed fair machine learning framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08081) under inference attacks. 
We design an attack strategy that infers the protected demographics by solving an integer programming problem,
then design a defense mechanism that perturbs the distributed learner.
